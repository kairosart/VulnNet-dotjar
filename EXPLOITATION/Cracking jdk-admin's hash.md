To crack the password hash `jdk-admin:$6$PQQxGZw5$fSSXp2EcFX0RNNOcu6uakkFjKDDWGw1H35uvQzaH44.I/5cwM0KsRpwIp8OcsOeQcmXJeJAk7SnwY6wV8A0z/1:18643:0:99999:7:::` using John the Ripper, follow these steps:

1. **Save the Hash:** Copy the hash line into a text file, for example, `jdk-admin.hash`. Ensure the file contains only the hash line and no extra characters.
    
2. **Run John the Ripper:** Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `jdk-admin.hash`, and run the following command:
    
    ```
    john jdk-admin.hash
    ```
    
    John the Ripper will automatically detect the hash format (in this case, SHA-512 crypt, indicated by the `$6$` prefix) and begin cracking using its default settings, which typically start with a wordlist attack.
    
3. **Use a Wordlist (Recommended):** For a faster and more effective attack, especially against common passwords, use a wordlist like `rockyou.txt`. The command would be:
    
    ```
    john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt jdk-admin.hash
    ```
    
    This command tells John to use the specified wordlist for cracking.
    
4. **Check Results:** Once the cracking process completes (or you interrupt it with Ctrl+C), use the `--show` command to display any cracked passwords:
    
    ```
    john --show jdk-admin.hash
    ```
